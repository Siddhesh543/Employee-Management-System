# Employee-Management-System
Employee Management System – A complete console application built with Java, Hibernate ORM, and MySQL.   Supports full CRUD for Employees, Departments, Designations, Attendance records, and monthly Salary processing with automatic net salary calculation.
# Employee Management System

A console-based **Employee Management System** developed using **Java**, **Hibernate ORM**, and **MySQL**.  
It provides complete **CRUD operations** for managing employees, departments, designations, attendance records, and salary processing — perfect for learning Java backend development, ORM concepts, and layered architecture (DAO + Service + Presentation).

## Features

- **Employee Management**  
  - Add new employee  
  - View employee by ID  
  - View all employees  
  - Update employee details (phone, salary, etc.)  
  - Delete employee  
  - Search employees by name  

- **Department Management**  
  - Add department  
  - View all departments  
  - Delete department  

- **Designation Management**  
  - Add designation  
  - View all designations  
  - Delete designation  

- **Attendance Management**  
  - Mark daily attendance  
  - (Basic view support through service layer)  

- **Salary Management**  
  - Process monthly salary  
  - Automatic net salary calculation (basic + allowances + bonus - deductions)  
  - View salary records  

- **Reports**  
  - Total count of employees, departments, designations  

- Clean console UI with formatted tables  
- Input validation & error handling  
- Email uniqueness check  
- Hibernate automatic schema generation (`hbm2ddl.auto = update`)  
- Proper transaction management  

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or higher)  
- Hibernate ORM (JPA annotations)  
- MySQL Database  
- Maven / manual JAR management (hibernate-core, mysql-connector-java)  
- Scanner (console input)  
- Layered architecture:  
  - Model (Entities)  
  - DAO (Data Access Objects)  
  - Service (Business Logic)  
  - Presentation (Console UI in `App.java`)

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher installed  
- MySQL 8+ server running  
- Database name: `hib_employeedb`  
  (will be auto-created/updated by Hibernate)

Default connection (change in `HibernateConfig.java` if needed):

```java
URL:  jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hib_employeedb?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
User: root
Pass: root

How to Run
Option 1: Using IDE (recommended)

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code
Make sure MySQL is running and database exists
Run App.java as Java Application

Option 2: Command Line (manual compile & run)
```
Bash# Compile
javac -cp "lib/*" src/com/employeesystem/*.java src/com/employeesystem/*/*.java

# Run
java -cp "src:lib/*" com.employeesystem.App
(Replace lib/* with actual path to your JAR files if needed)
Sample Usage Flow

Start the application
Choose option 1 → Employee Management → 1 → Add Employee
Follow prompts (name, email, department ID, designation ID, salary, hire date...)
Use option 6 → Reports to see counts
Exit with 0

Database Schema (auto-generated by Hibernate)
Main tables:

employees
departments
designations
attendance
salaries

Future Enhancements (Ideas)

Add user login & role-based access
Generate PDF salary slips
Attendance summary (present/absent days per month)
Leave management module
Convert to Spring Boot + REST API + React/Angular frontend
Export data to CSV/Excel

text### Tips for best GitHub presentation

1. Add a nice project banner / screenshot at the top (optional but looks professional)
   Example:

   ```markdown
   ![Employee Management System](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400.png?text=Employee+Management+System)
(later replace placeholder with real screenshot)

Create sections with emoji for better readability:

If you add a LICENSE file → link it properly
Add badges (optional but looks good):Markdown![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)
![Hibernate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hibernate-59666C?style=for-the-badge&logo=hibernate&logoColor=white)
